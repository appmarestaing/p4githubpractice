# Create a function that asks for someones birth year and then prints out how old they will be in 2025.




# Math stuff
a = 100
b = 200 
c = 9 * a
d = b / 2
print(c)
print(a ** 2)

# Does anyone know how we could convert this back into an integer?
print(d)


# Input and Output
num1 = input("what number do you want?")
print(num1 * 2)


# Creating a variable
# What are these called where it's like a word in quotes?
first_name = "noah"
last_name = "marestaing"

# How would we make it so that they are spaced out?
full_name = first_name + last_name
print(full_name)

# How would we ask the user instead of just always printing out the same name?

# How could we make that into a function?
